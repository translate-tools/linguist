By default, you may choose one of the embedded translators, you may even use an offline translator for privacy-sensitive texts.\\n\\nAlthough Linguist does not limit you to embedded translators, you may integrate literally any third-party service with Linguist. ChatGPT, DeepL, Ollama, or anything else, you may integrate it all as a [custom translator](/docs/CustomTranslator).\\n\\nThis feature is especially useful for those involved in research work and using Linguist intensively to translate content in many foreign languages, when standard translators may not provide good enough translation quality, or when translation must be fine-tuned.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is a custom translator?\\n\\nA custom translator is a Javascript code that implements the `Translator` interface to fetch translations for requested source text and language to a target language.\\n\\nYou may implement the translator yourself if you can program, see [custom translator interface](/docs/CustomTranslator) that must be implemented.\\n\\nAlternatively, you may find the code of the translator in the [public translators list](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist-translators). If there is no translator for the service you want to have, feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist-translators/issues/new/choose) about it.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nTo add a custom translator, follow these steps\\n\\n- Go to the settings page and click \\"Manage translators\\" ![](settings.png)\\n- Click the button to add a new translator ![](./custom-translators-list.png)\\n- Insert the code of the custom translator ![](./custom-translator-editor.png)\\n\\n## Security\\n\\nTechnically, a custom translator code runs in a browser extension context, so **you must never paste untrusted code**.\\n\\nActually, the code is sandboxed via an iframe with no origin context, so there is no access to the browser extension API. The iframe context is patched to transparently proxify a [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), so any requests will be forwarded through the browser extension context, to make it possible to request any resources with no CORS limitations.\\n\\nThis design is needed to allow you to fetch any API, even those that set strict CORS rules, or are deployed locally. You may just call any API with no hassle.\\n\\nThe sandbox must prevent any potential ability to run custom code in a browser extension context. So this code must not be able to read or modify content on web pages or anything like this.\\n\\nHowever, **it is potentially possible to make authenticated requests** to any services, so *if you use untrusted code, hackers may steal your data or money from your bank account*."},{"id":"/release/6.0.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release/6.0.0","source":"@site/blog/release/6.0.0.md","title":"Release 6.0.0","description":"Manifest V3 and sandboxed translators","date":"2024-06-25T16:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":1,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Vitonsky","title":"Founder of Linguist Translate","url":"https://vitonsky.net","email":"robert@vitonsky.net","imageURL":"https://github.com/vitonsky.png","key":"vitonsky","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 6.0.0","description":"Manifest V3 and sandboxed translators","authors":["vitonsky"],"tags":["release"],"date":"2024-06-25T16:00"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Use any translation service in browser via Linguist","permalink":"/blog/2025/09/04/user-modules"}},"content":"Key changes in [new release](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist/releases/tag/v6.0.0).\\n\\n- Chrome extension moved to a Manifest v3\\n- Custom translators code now run in sandboxed iframe with no access to addon API\\n- New option to disable translation history recording https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist/issues/151\\n- Minor bug fixes and improvements, see [milestone](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist/milestone/7?closed=1)\\n\\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist/compare/v5.0.17...6.0.0\\n\\n## Improved security\\n\\nNow custom translators executes in sandboxed context, so they no have access to addon API.\\n\\nUsers now may use custom translators with lower trust level. Custom translator still may sent requests to any domains from your browser, and still may mine on your hardware as any other software, but custom translator can\'t inspect content on pages and do other things that browser extensions do.\\n\\n## Manifest V3\\n\\nA chrome [announced](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/#the_phase-out_timeline) they will deprecate and disable extensions with manifest v2 soon. So Linguist migrate to manifest v3 on Chrome and stay on manifest v2 on Firefox.\\n\\nDue to some limitations of Manifest V3, Linguist may not work on too old browsers like Chrome 109 and older."}]}}')}}]);
