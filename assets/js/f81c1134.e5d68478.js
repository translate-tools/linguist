Custom translator still may sent requests to any domains from your browser, and still may mine on your hardware as any other software, but custom translator can\'t inspect content on pages and do other things that browser extensions do.\\n\\n## Manifest V3\\n\\nA chrome [announced](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/#the_phase-out_timeline) they will deprecate and disable extensions with manifest v2 soon.
