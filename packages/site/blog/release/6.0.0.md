## Improved security

Now custom translators executes in sandboxed context, so they no have access to addon API.

Users now may use custom translators with lower trust level. Custom translator still may sent requests to any domains from your browser, and still may mine on your hardware as any other software, but custom translator can't inspect content on pages and do other things that browser extensions do.

## Manifest V3

A chrome [announced](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/#the_phase-out_timeline) they will deprecate and disable extensions with manifest v2 soon. So Linguist migrate to manifest v3 on Chrome and stay on manifest v2 on Firefox.

Due to some limitations of Manifest V3, Linguist may not work on too old browsers like Chrome 109 and older.
